It is a basic demo environment to see how "would" your investment develop by the time, in the world of coins. Since cyrpto currencies  get more popular every day, I wanted to see what would happen to my capital if I would invest them certain coins and created this Web application. Since it is a demo environment and there are many crypto currency investor who has less knowledge about finance, dynamics of coins etc. CoinsDemo offers basic and plain interface with easy read datas. After sign-up users will have 10.000$ cash* to invest on crypto currencies.
